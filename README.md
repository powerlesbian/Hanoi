# Hanoi
"The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower[1] and sometimes pluralized as Towers, or simply pyramid puzzle[2]) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape."

This game is played out on screen with user entering the number of discs.  Part of MIT Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN assignment in week 10.
